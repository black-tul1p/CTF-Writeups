## Description

UMDCTF 2021 is the fifth annual cybersecurity competition event created and hosted by students in the cybersecurity club at University of Maryland, College Park. Teams will compete side-by-side in various challenges created by UMD students in the cybersecurity club that will test their speed, knowledge, and skill in various areas of cybersecurity. Challenges are solved when users find the “flag”, a string of text which gives them points proportional to the difficulty of the challenge.

I found `pwn`, `rev` and `programming` to be the hardest sections in this CTF.
