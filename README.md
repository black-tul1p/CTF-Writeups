This is a repository of writeups for various CTF challenges that I have successfully completed. Not all the solutions that are provided may have been the intention of the creator of the challenge but I will make sure to mention this where necessary, since it can prove helpful to both the solver and the creator. I hope this helps you!

My favorite categories so far include `pwn`, `rev`, `OSINT`, and `forensics`.
