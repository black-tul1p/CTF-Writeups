# Solution:

We have to find a way to print the flag using a command that is less than 10 characters long. We can use a python builtin called `help()` for this. Calling `help(flag)` returns:

```
>>> help(flag)
No Python documentation found for 'pctf{JusT_a5k_4_h3lP!}'.
Use help() to get the interactive help utility.
Use help(str) for help on the str class.
```

This gives us the flag: `pctf{JusT_a5k_4_h3lP!}`
