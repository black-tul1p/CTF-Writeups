# Hints from author(s)

- Text Editors can be helpful
- Remember to use CyberChef for decoding Hex and Base64
- Base64 may appear to be base64, until base64 isn't actually base64... That is until you look at the source

# Solve

Looking at the source code, we can see a tag named `flag` with the value `UklUU0VDe0gzcjMhdCEkfQ==`. Decode using CyberChef and get the flag.

### Flag

`RITSEC{H3r3!t!$}`
