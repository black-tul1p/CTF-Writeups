### Title: Music Signs

Geno occasionally keeps up with his exâ€™s music interests. What do they say about her personality?

# Solution

Looking at Geno's LinkedIn profile's About section, we can see a link to a personal website. Upon visiting that website and clicking on `View my photos`, we are taken to his Twitter page . Looking at his followers, we can see the profile of his ex, Claire Eng. In her bio, we see a link to her spotify profile, where she has a playlist titled `RS` with a description `{}` (a hint that the flag is here). Reading the first character of each song in the playlist, we see a word emerge: `SAGITTARIUS`. This is the flag.
