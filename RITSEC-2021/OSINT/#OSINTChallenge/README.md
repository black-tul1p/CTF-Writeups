# Description

### Title: #OSINTChallenge

The CEO of Genoâ€™s company loves local art and nature. Where was she when she took the photo in her Twitter background? (Wrap the answer in RS{} and use underscores between each word.)

# Solution

From Geno's LinkedIn profile, we can go to the profile of Bridgewater Investigations and look at the list of employees by clicking on `See all 3 employees on LinkedIn`. From here, we get the photo of the CEO. If we google the description of their job title (Chief Executive Officer at Bridgewater Investigations), we get a link to the CEO's LinkedIn profile. From this, we get her name, which we can use to search for her twitter account. From her bio, we know she's a Rochesterian and in her Twitter background, we can see a peace sign in a garden.

Go to google maps and search for "Rochester Peace Sign Garden", which takes us to the Durand Eastman Park. This gives us the flag.
